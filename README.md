# sentiment-analysis-chat-bot

this code makes a chat-bot using tkinter which runs the ML trained sentiment analysis code.

for sentiment analysis we are using the IMDB review database, and training and testing via the same.

First run the Text_sentiment and then save it. Currently it is at 100 epochs, increase it if you would like to.

then run the chatbot_gui.py: it will first train the model and then you can ask for any review or analysis in a chatbot.
